The following day I called them to withdraw one item. The estimated fee they wrote for the item was $300-500. The item is worth much more. The auction house now made me pay $500 in order for me to drive and reclaim the item. I am willing to go to small claims court. The question is the venue. Where do I file- New York City or Salem, Massachusetts? Thank you. Also,\r\nis there any \"buyer's remorse\"\r\napplicable in this situation?"}

I am currently the plaintiff of a Capias Warrant Arrest against a gentleman named Gary Sylvester. This man used to be my landlord who went above and beyond to illegally evict us from his house, so I brought him to court and won the Small Claims division. This was about 6 months ago. Gary was issued a court date which was mandatory for him to show up to in order for me to receive payment, but he never showed which resulted in my issuing of a Capias Warrant. It has now been 6 months since I hired Deputy Sheriff Harry Martin from Falmouth, MA to contact Gary in order for myself to receive the payment that rightfully belongs to me. The last time I spoke to Harry, he replied by saying that his sticky notes on Gary's door and voicemails have gone unanswered, (I wonder why). I would've thought that an arrest would've been made by now, but I can now see that is not the case! I've tried contacting Harry and asking for other options, or if he personally knew Gary and that was why it was taking him so long, but I was unsuccessful in receiving a solid answer. He simply replied with \"Wait for me to call you\" and I have been waiting for a while now. No one is allowed to give me any legal advice, but I just want to know if there is any other way in getting Gary to pay me, such as hiring another sheriff who focuss mainly on Capias Warrants? In another 6 months, this Capias will expire and I will have to renew it and I'm nervous I'm going to end up back where I started. Please help me! Looking forward to your reply, \r\n\r\nGrace"}

(i tried to locate it but to no avail.)\r\n\r\n3. being that i am out of state, filing by mail is okay, correct? understanding it isn't official until the claim form has been received.\r\n\r\n4. is there anything i need to know and\/or understand prior to moving forward? my preference is to settle this even before i fill out the form, but if i can't, i am wondering if there is anything additional i should be aware of.\r\n\r\nthank you\r\nstacey"}
