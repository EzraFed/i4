The following day I called them to withdraw one item. The estimated fee they wrote for the item was $300-500. The item is worth much more. The auction house now made me pay $500 in order for me to drive and reclaim the item. I am willing to go to small claims court. The question is the venue. Where do I file- New York City or Salem, Massachusetts? Thank you. Also,\r\nis there any \"buyer's remorse\"\r\napplicable in this situation?"}
