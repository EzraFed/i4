I am currently the plaintiff of a Capias Warrant Arrest against a gentleman named Gary Sylvester. This man used to be my landlord who went above and beyond to illegally evict us from his house, so I brought him to court and won the Small Claims division. This was about 6 months ago. Gary was issued a court date which was mandatory for him to show up to in order for me to receive payment, but he never showed which resulted in my issuing of a Capias Warrant. It has now been 6 months since I hired Deputy Sheriff Harry Martin from Falmouth, MA to contact Gary in order for myself to receive the payment that rightfully belongs to me. The last time I spoke to Harry, he replied by saying that his sticky notes on Gary's door and voicemails have gone unanswered, (I wonder why). I would've thought that an arrest would've been made by now, but I can now see that is not the case! I've tried contacting Harry and asking for other options, or if he personally knew Gary and that was why it was taking him so long, but I was unsuccessful in receiving a solid answer. He simply replied with \"Wait for me to call you\" and I have been waiting for a while now. No one is allowed to give me any legal advice, but I just want to know if there is any other way in getting Gary to pay me, such as hiring another sheriff who focuss mainly on Capias Warrants? In another 6 months, this Capias will expire and I will have to renew it and I'm nervous I'm going to end up back where I started. Please help me! Looking forward to your reply, \r\n\r\nGrace"}

He was hired to do various repair\/renovation work at her home. Upon completion of the tiling job, he had his work approved by the homeowner and she paid the balance of the bill. Total $375. He continued on with other work at her house for a week after he completed tiling. During that time she said there was a tile that had cracked grout. My husband agreed that the grout around 1 of the tiles was cracked. He removed, recemented and regrouted tile. A week later, she called to say the toilet was leaking. He returned the following day to check out the toilet. She had not replaced the toilet. The toilet was _20 old. He found slight leakage after flushing toilet. He replaced a flange and wax ring and reset the toilet. No more leak. A week later she called to say that the grout looks like it is 2 different colors. He assured her it was not. He said I am tied up with my current job for the next 2 weeks, but after that I will return so that u can show me what u mean. A few days later she left a message on phone saying she could not live with the tiling job and she wanted him to return the $375 plus pay her for the tile she had bought ($125). She said if you don't i am going to have the floor replaced and send u the bill. He said no....I will come look at the floor and make things right. She accused him of stealing 2 boxes of left over tiles. He told her that she did not have any leftover tile. The bathroom was 42sq ft and she had 40+ tiles. She said u must have broken alot of tiles, because there is no way that bathroom used all the tiles. She didn't seem to get the math involved. \r\nShe said she had a professional come and inspect the floor and he was able to pop many of the tiles in the floor and she hired him to replace the floor. She said she has pictures of the disaster. She is suing my husband for $931. \r\nMy husband has pictures of the completed floor and many other tile jobs. He has been in business since 2004, but he has done this work for 30 yrs. He has put together a timeline from when he started working for this customer to the last phone call from her. We have contacted customers that have gladly written letters stating they were very satisfied with his work. He is currently working at a home that he renovated a bathroom at last year. That homeowner said she would gladly be a witness for him in court. \r\nMIy husband pricec jobs fairly. He do not gouge customers, as he know there is alot of competition in this field of work. He has mostly repeat customers. He is a very hard worker and is easy to get along with. Sometimes too easy. One of her neighbors recommended my husband to her. Another 1 of the neighbors said if I knew u were going to do work for her, I would have told u don't bother. She is very hard to please. \r\nI know this is a very \"he said, she said\" scenario, but what kind of things does my husband need to prove to win this case?\r\nThank you for your time."}

He has refused every attempt to work this out w\/me and has not answered a single call or letter since 3 weeks before I moved out on feb 1,2013.

Both tables have chunks missing out of it and there are also cracks in various places on both of them as well. The men who are directly responsible made no indication of what they try to reimburse, (apparently 60 cents per pound,) and said plainly that the company is fully insured, (which is true,) however, the man who seemed to be in charge asked for the work order to be signed so they could leave and that everything would be taken care of as far as what was damaged.

{"date":1379031733,"name":"Nancy Neary","email":"nancys1456@yahoo.com","zip":"01904","subject":"Small Claims and also Appeal of Judgment in Family & Probate Court","message":"My ex husband chose to buy me out 6 years ago, but did not come up with all of the money. We put a clause in the divorce agreement that if that should happen, he would have five years to pay me that money plus 5% simple interest. A year before it was due, he approached out oldest son, who had just been laid off, and asked him to come do work on the house so he could rent it out again, as he had lost his prior renters. Actually,I found out later that the prior renters took him to court for overcharging for utilities. The court found in their favor and awarded triple damages, equivalent to $9,000. They subsequently got a restraining order on my ex because he had been harassing their young children, entering the part of the home where they rented without notice or permission, etc. My son agreed to help him fix the place up for pay. During that time, my ex started asking my son to try to get me and our other two children to move back into the home. He begged us to move back because he could not find a renter and was going to lose the house. The money he owed me was in the form of a lien or second mortgage on the property, so after four months of him pleading with me and our children, we moved back in to save him from foreclosure. I felt that I would never see that money if he ended up losing the house. He also promised to fix many of the problems with the house -- things normal renters would have had a problem with -- and told my son if he did painting, repairs, put in a back door, finished the tiling in the upstairs bathroom, etc., he would either pay him or put the amount toward rent. He also said he would agree to let us live there if I gave him all the child support money as rent, which I did. He also said he planned to move out in a month's time and into an apartment with his then girlfriend. This part was a relief to me, as I have had to get restraining orders on him in the past due to harassment and stalking. Thinking that he would be moving out of the basement apartment in a short month was great. However, he never did move out and during that year, he harassed us constantly, neglected to repair all the things he promised he would,etc. When it came close to the time he would have to pay me the money, he served us with a notice to quit. Then he did move out and shut off all the electricity and cable. Then he took me to court and had the child support stopped and refused to pay me alimony. I had to get a reduced rate lawyer because I only make $300 a week. My lawyer filed for alimony and also filed contempt against my ex for not paying the balance of what he owed me from the buyout. I did get alimony, but he technically owes me back alimony because I went without anything for four months from the time my lawyer filed until the alimony started coming. My ex's lawyer said we would take care of that when we settled on the buyout money. We ended up having an evidentiary hearing and the judge took six months to make a decision. On August 5th she ruled in my favor and said my ex has to pay me the money within 60 days. Now he has filed an appeal on that decision. Also, he filed in small claims court against me for $6,900, stating we vandalized his home when we lived there, ruined the carpets, left trash behind and made changes in the building's structure without permission. This man is pure evil and is lying through his teeth. Not only does he want to get out of paying me what is rightfully mine, he is also trying to get thousands of dollars from me for things I did not do. I am basically homeless at this point, sleeping on a family member's couch. Can someone please help??? Thank you."}

The defendant (and the condo in question) are in Pittsfield, Berkshire County.\r\n\r\nWe (the \"estate\") won the case before a magistrate. The defendant appealed and a trial was held before Judge Paul Yee (Quincy District Court, on visiting rotation in Concord). Judge Yee reversed the ruling and ruled for the defendant. He also awarded damages of $3000 in legal fees and $700 in transportation expenses to the defendant.\r\n\r\nOur case was presented by my brother and I. My brother is a party to the suit and is also an attorney by training, but is not currently a member of the Mass. Bar and was appearing as a party, not as counsel. The defendant (Berkshire Realty) represented herself at the initial trial, but hired a local attorney for the appeal.\r\n\r\nMy questions:\r\n\r\n- is the damage award appropriate\/legal? The small claims guidelines and standards documents don't contain any provisions for damages to the plaintiff (it specifies that the defendant can counter-sue if appropriate).\r\n\r\n- the transportation award seems especially unfair, as the small claims guidelines specify that I should file in the court in my home district. The judge's ruling says that I should have filed in Berkshire County, but that seems to be a mis-application of small claims court rules.\r\n\r\n- why should we be held liable for the defendant's legal expenses? It seems to me that the initial ruling in our favor at the minimum shows that our claim had merit and wasn't frivolous or harassing.\r\n\r\n- we filed a motion for reconsideration, but after 6 months the judge just re-affirmed his earlier award.\r\n\r\n- what can we do to dispute this award? It seems that any additional motions to the same judge aren't likely to fare any better.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\n-Bob"}

I would have to bring the Consumer Protection Act, the Security Deposit Law, Housing Codes and Building Codes. 3)These landlords never gave us their address, only a PO box so I had to sleuth out their address and I have no confirmation that it's correct. Apparently I could lose the case(?) if they don't show up but then prove they didn't receive Notice. Is that possible and what could they possibly do? At what point can I push for a personal summons or whatever so we can be sure they get it? Is there another way to confirm it?\r\n\r\nThank you so much!\r\nRebecca"}

I recently ended a 3-year residence at an Allston, MA property and my landlord is currently putting us through the motions with reclaiming our security deposit. Could you elaborate on what is protected from deduction as \"reasonable wear and tear?\" My landlord wants to repaint the outer stairwell on account of scuffs from our bike tires over the years, and I suspect he will also make an issue of a small scuff in the wall in our apartment, the holes made by door handles, and the several small holes made by picture mounts and, in one area, darts (before we protected the area with corkboard). All of this seems like it can be remedied with a light coat of paint and maybe some plaster, and some sources (http:\/\/www.somervillema.gov\/departments\/fair-housing-commission\/faq) state that such need for repainting falls under the category of \"reasonable wear and tear.\" Is it? Can he charge us for this, and if so, how much should he reasonably be able to charge?\r\n\r\nAny information you could provide there would be most appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nNed Hinman"}

An ex of mine told me she wanted to take me to small claims court for supposedly hurting her credit score by closing a joint card account we had together (which I paid off on my own then closed legally). So she told me months ago she's taking me to small claims court. Today, my mom told me she got a slip that said I have certified mail that needs my signature or it will be returned to sender in 15 days. My mom lives in Connecticut. What should I do? I am assuming the mail was my summons, but don't know for sure. Can I be held liable if it's returned to the court? My legal address in in Brighton."}

The question i have is - Do i need to fill any other form other than \"statement of small claim and notice of trial\" for claiming triple damages OR do i need to fill this form according to any other standard for example chapter 93(a). Some lady in court told me that i need to fill the claim according to chapter 93(a) but i am unable to find anywhere that chapter 93(a) is applicable for landlord or tenant case also.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAtish"}
